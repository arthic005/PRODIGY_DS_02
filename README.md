# PRODIGY_DS_02
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **Task-02**, where we perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Train dataset**. The main objective is to **clean the data, explore patterns, and extract insights** .
# Titanic Dataset Analysis (Task-02)
## Notebook Contents

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) using Pandas.
   - Display the first few rows for an initial overview.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`).
   - Drop unnecessary columns (like `Cabin` with too many missing values).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions of key features: `Age`, `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Fare`.
   - Analyze survival rates across different categories:
     - By gender
     - By passenger class
     - By age groups

4. **Finding Relationships & Trends**
   - Use barplots and histograms to identify patterns.
   - Observe which groups had higher chances of survival.

5. **Insights**
   - Women had a higher survival rate than men.
   - Passengers in higher classes (Pclass=1) survived more.
   - Age and fare also show trends in survival.
